#Homework 5

For this assignment, there are 3 recursion classes: Fibonacci, Multiplication, and StringToInt. The Fibonacci class has a single method that recursively returns the fibonacci number at the given index. The Multiplication class has a single method that recursively returns two numbers multiplied. The StringToInt class has 2 methods - one that the user would use where the only input is the string of numbers, and a second that optimizes the users input for a recursive method. This allows the user to only need to worry about the string they want converted, and ignore all of the book keeping that the recusive method requires.

There is also a 4th class that deals with the balanced parentheses problem. This problem takes in a string of parentheses of either () or [] type, and returns whether or not the parentheses are balanced. It uses for loops and if statements to go through the string and push or pop the items into or out of a stack. 

Please use `javac` and `java` on the App.java file in `Homework5/src/main/java` for this homework assignment.
